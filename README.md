Welcome to the official website of International Conference on Data Science in Biology (ICDSB). The ICDSB conference series will be held annually to provide an interactive forum for presentation and discussion on Data Science and Computational Biology. The ICBCB 2020 will be held virtually during September 3-5, 2020. The conference welcomes participants from all over the world who are interested in developing professional ties to and/or exploring career opportunities in the region. The conference should serve as an ideal forum to establish relationships from within India and other regions of the world. This is the first time such inter-disciplinary conference is being organized on data science with inclination towards biology .

Data science is an emerging field with a plethora of opportunities in biology. In the near future, biological data is expected to dominate the data science field. The conference aims to bring together experts working in the data science domain with inclination toward solving biology related problems. Our audience is expected to be diverse with a background in biology/genomics/bioinformatics/data science. Therefore, a full day workshop will be organized covering the concepts of data science and molecular biology on September 3, 2020.

The conference proceedings will be published in the International Journal of Computational Biology (IJCB).
